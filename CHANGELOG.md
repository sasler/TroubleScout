# Changelog

All notable changes to TroubleScout will be documented in this file.

## [v1.5.0] - 2026-03-03

### ✨ Features

- 🔌 **Multi-server `--server` flag** — Pass `--server` multiple times or use comma-separated values to connect to several servers at startup (e.g., `--server srv1 --server srv2` or `--server srv1,srv2`). CLI help updated to reflect multi-server syntax.
- 🖥️ **`/server` slash command** (replaces `/connect`) — Consistent with the CLI flag. Accepts multiple servers in a single call: `/server srv1 srv2` or `/server srv1,srv2`. Both space- and comma-separated syntax work.
- ⏹️ **ESC cancels the in-progress agent turn** — Press ESC while the AI is thinking to cancel the current turn at the SDK level. The spinner now shows `(ESC to stop)` at all times as a visible hint. On cancellation a clear `[Cancelled]` indicator is shown.
- ⌨️ **Prompt history** — Up/Down arrow keys recall previous inputs during the interactive prompt. ESC clears the current input buffer.
- 💭 **Reasoning display** — When a model emits reasoning/thinking tokens (`AssistantReasoningEvent`), they are streamed in dark grey with a 💭 prefix before the main response, giving visibility into the model's thought process.

### ⬆️ Dependencies

- ⬆️ **GitHub.Copilot.SDK upgraded to v0.1.29** — Removes the `--headless` flag that caused startup crashes with Copilot CLI v0.0.420. Adds defensive error handling around SDK startup to surface clean diagnostics on failure.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- 🐛 **Fix PSSession approval dialog** — The `LiveThinkingIndicator` background spinner was overwriting `AnsiConsole.Confirm` prompts for `connect_server` approval. The indicator now pauses during approval dialogs and resumes after.
- 🐛 **Fix `/byok clear` memory state** — `/byok clear` now resets in-memory BYOK state so a subsequent `/model` switch does not re-save `UseByokOpenAi=true` to disk.
- 🐛 **Fix multi-server agent awareness** — Agent system message now lists all active PSSessions so the AI knows which servers are connected without needing to ask the user.
- 🐛 **Fix reasoning display** — Reasoning tokens now stream incrementally via `AssistantReasoningDeltaEvent` instead of appearing all at once.

### ✨ Additions

- ✨ **`--no-byok` CLI flag** — Forces the GitHub Copilot provider at startup, ignoring any saved BYOK provider selection.

## [v1.4.0] - 2026-02-27

✨ **Features**

- 🖧 **Multi-server PSSession support** — Use `connect_server` and `close_server_session` tools to establish direct connections to multiple servers, avoiding PowerShell Remoting double-hop authentication issues. Run commands on any connected server via `run_powershell` with an optional `sessionName` parameter.
- 🔀 **Accurate provider/model switching** — Dual-source models (available via both GitHub Copilot and BYOK) now appear as separate entries in `/model`, making it explicit which provider will be used. Post-switch confirmation shows both model and provider.
- 🔧 **Richer tool/MCP usage display** — Tool invocations show human-readable descriptions (e.g., "Scanning Event Logs" instead of "get_event_logs"). MCP tool calls show the server name. Tool invocation count tracked in `/status`.

🛡️ **Reliability & Safety Improvements**

- ⬆️ **GitHub.Copilot.SDK updated to v0.1.28** — addresses breaking change requiring permission handler; read-only tool operations auto-approved in all modes; mutating MCP/shell operations prompt for approval in Safe mode.
- 🔒 **Execution mode changes apply live** — switching `/mode safe` or `/mode yolo` now immediately affects permission decisions, including for active multi-server sessions.
- 🛡️ **Multi-session command routing** — Approved commands for alternate server sessions now execute on the correct server, with proper target verification.
- 🔁 **Session executor robustness** — Additional PSSession executors are safely disposed even if one fails; execution mode propagates to all active sessions.

📝 **Documentation & UX**

- 💬 **Clearer AI guidance** — System message now explicitly encourages tool use, explains read-only tools auto-execute in all modes, and includes double-hop avoidance instructions.
- 📊 **Provider row in status** — `/status` and `/capabilities` now show the active provider (GitHub Copilot or BYOK) as a dedicated row alongside the AI model.

## [v1.3.4] - 2026-02-27

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- 🐛 Fix `--help` / `-h` to display proper CLI usage (flags, options, examples) instead of the TUI slash-command reference
- 🐛 Fix `--mode` with missing value to emit a clear error and exit with code 1 instead of silently ignoring
- 🐛 Add missing-value error handling for all flags that require values (`--server`, `--prompt`, `--model`, `--mcp-config`, `--skills-dir`, `--disable-skill`, `--openai-base-url`, `--openai-api-key`); `--model` additionally hints to use `/model` interactively
- 🐛 Remove undocumented `-debug` alias; debug mode is now enabled only via `-d` or `--debug`

## [v1.2.4] - 2026-02-06

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

  - Publish to an explicit output directory and package from there
  - Update GitHub Release action to v2
  - Always include a `runtimes/` directory in the zip (copied if present, otherwise created empty)

## [v1.2.3] - 2026-02-06

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

- 🐛 Fix PowerShell SDK initialization in single-file published executables
  - Added `IncludeNativeLibrariesForSelfExtract` and `IncludeAllContentForSelfExtract` properties to enable proper resource extraction
  - Re-enabled `PublishSingleFile=true` for clean distribution (exe + runtimes folder only)
  - PowerShell SDK now extracts required configuration files to temp directory at runtime

### ✅ Testing

- ✅ Fixed test isolation issues in `AppSettingsStoreTests` with sequential execution
- ✅ All 74 tests passing with improved file handle cleanup
- ✅ Added GC collection to prevent file locking issues between tests

### 📝 Technical Details

- Root cause: PowerShell SDK requires physical configuration files, but single-file mode embeds them
- Solution: Use .NET's extraction properties to automatically extract embedded resources at runtime
- Package now distributes as clean single-file exe (125 MB) with runtimes folder, matching v1.0.x structure

## [v1.2.2] - 2026-02-06

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

- 🐛 Fix PowerShell SDK initialization failure in published executables
  - Removed `PublishSingleFile=true` from build configuration
  - PowerShell SDK requires configuration files on disk that aren't compatible with single-file publishing
  - Application now ships as TroubleScout.exe with supporting DLLs in the same folder

### 📝 Technical Details

- Root cause: PowerShell SDK's `PSSnapInReader.ReadEnginePSSnapIns()` calls `Path.Combine` with null paths when configuration files are unavailable
- Single-file publishing embeds resources but PowerShell SDK needs physical files (PowerShell.Format.ps1xml, etc.)
- Solution: Distribute as standard published application with all required files

## [v1.2.1] - 2026-02-06

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- 🐛 Fix null path exception in published executable when `ApplicationData` is unavailable

- ✨ Make `GetCopilotCliPath` testable by changing visibility to `internal`

### ✅ Testing
