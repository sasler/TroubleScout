## [v1.17.9] - 2026-05-11

### Internal

- 🧭 **Extract model and BYOK slash commands** - `/model` and `/byok` now flow through `SlashCommandDispatcher.DispatchAsync`; BYOK setup now uses the same model picker as `/model`, and BYOK sessions use a non-streaming compatibility mode for OpenAI-compatible gateways that reject streaming usage options.

## [v1.17.8] - 2026-05-11

### Internal

- 🧭 **Extract remaining low-risk slash commands** - `/clear`, `/settings`, `/login`, and `/mcp-role` now flow through `SlashCommandDispatcher.DispatchAsync`, preserving session reset, live settings reload, Copilot login, and MCP role mapping behavior with focused dispatcher coverage.

## [v1.17.7] - 2026-05-10

### Internal

- 🧭 **Extract session permission handling** - SDK permission decisions, URL approval state, MCP approval state, and `/mcp-approvals` state operations now live in `SessionPermissionHandler`, keeping `TroubleshootingSession` focused on session orchestration while preserving Safe/YOLO, URL, shell, and MCP approval behavior.

## [v1.17.6] - 2026-05-10

### Internal

- 🧭 **Extract prompt templates** - Long AI-facing system, agent, and turn prompts now live in embedded Markdown templates loaded through a small template renderer, preserving settings-based system prompt overrides and adding focused rendering coverage for default, multi-server, JEA, and MCP role prompt scenarios.

## [v1.17.5] - 2026-05-10

### Internal

- 🧭 **Extract `/jea` slash-command dispatch** - `/jea` now flows through `SlashCommandDispatcher.DispatchAsync`, preserving guided prompts, example output, skip-approval connection, discovered-command display, status refresh, and AI session recreation with focused dispatcher tests.

## [v1.17.4] - 2026-05-10

### Internal

- 🧭 **Extract `/server` slash-command dispatch** - `/server` now flows through `SlashCommandDispatcher.DispatchAsync`, preserving direct multi-server connection parsing, Safe-mode approvals outside spinners, additional-target session refresh, and status output with focused dispatcher tests.

## [v1.17.3] - 2026-05-10

### Internal

- 🧭 **Extract `/mcp-approvals` slash-command dispatch** - `/mcp-approvals` now flows through `SlashCommandDispatcher.DispatchAsync`, preserving active and persisted approval listing plus per-server and clear-all removal semantics with focused dispatcher tests.

## [v1.17.2] - 2026-05-10

### Internal

- 🧭 **Extract `/report` slash-command dispatch** - `/report` now flows through `SlashCommandDispatcher.DispatchAsync`, preserving no-history handling, temp HTML report generation, browser-open behavior, and success/warning messages with focused dispatcher tests.

## [v1.17.1] - 2026-05-09

### Internal

- 🧭 **Extract `/reasoning` slash-command dispatch** - `/reasoning` now flows through `SlashCommandDispatcher.DispatchAsync`, with focused tests for unsupported models, invalid efforts, unchanged preferences, save-only updates, active-session recreation, and rollback on restart failure. Added `docs/slash-command-dispatcher-roadmap.md` to track the remaining complex command extractions.

## [v1.17.0] - 2026-05-09

### Features

- 📝 **Opt-in transcript export and import** - `/transcript save <path>` writes a redacted, versioned session transcript JSON file, and `/transcript load <path>` imports validated transcript history so `/report` and `/model` second-opinion context can reuse it. Transcript persistence remains explicit and is never automatic.

## [v1.16.2] - 2026-05-09

### Documentation

- 🧭 **Generate slash-command reference from the registry** - `SlashCommandRegistry` now carries the category, usage, summary, details, and examples needed to render `docs/slash-commands.md`, and a drift test fails when the checked-in reference no longer matches the registry-generated Markdown.

### Security

- 🔒 **Patch Nerdbank.MessagePack advisory** - pin `Nerdbank.MessagePack` to `1.1.62` to avoid the vulnerable transitive `1.0.2` pulled in through the Copilot/JSON-RPC dependency chain.

## [v1.16.1] - 2026-05-03

### Internal

- 🧭 **Extract slash-command dispatch** - simple interactive commands now flow through `SlashCommandDispatcher`, keeping registry-backed suggestions/help aligned while moving low-risk command behavior out of `TroubleshootingSession.RunInteractiveLoopAsync`. Added dispatcher tests for command matching, fallthrough, exit handling, `/mode`, `/theme`, `/save`, and `/copy`.

## [v1.16.0] - 2026-05-02

### Security

- 🔐 **Redact secrets in persisted session surfaces** - `/report`, report Markdown export/copy sources, second-opinion replay context, `/save`, and `/copy` now pass persisted content through `SecretRedactor`. User prompts, assistant replies, PowerShell command/output text, MCP arguments/output, and report summary strings are scrubbed before they leave the live terminal stream.

### Internal

- 🧭 **Start slash-command registry refactor** - slash-command suggestions and `/help` now share `SlashCommandRegistry` metadata, laying groundwork for generated docs and safer dispatcher extraction.
- 🤖 **Bridge Codex and GitHub Copilot repo instructions** - `AGENTS.md` now points Codex at relevant `.github` prompts/templates/workflows, a shared `.github/instructions/repository.instructions.md` file gives GitHub Copilot the same PR/review expectations, and the PR template now requires gitmoji-style PR titles.
- ✅ **Warning-clean build** - cleaned nullable warnings in `TroubleshootingSessionTests` so `dotnet build` completes with 0 warnings.

## [v1.15.0] - 2026-04-30

### ✨ New Features

- 🎨 **`/theme` slash command** - choose between `dark` (default) and `mono`. Theme is persisted in `settings.json` (`Theme`) and applies to **app chrome only** (panels, status bar). It deliberately does NOT retint Markdown response rendering, reasoning ANSI text, or the live spinner — those would require a palette/renderer abstraction that is intentionally out of scope for this release. (`light` was floated during planning but is not yet supported because it would currently render identically to `dark`; it'll come back when there's a real palette behind it.)
- 💾 **`/save <path>` slash command** - writes the last assistant response (Markdown source) to disk. Strict by design: refuses directory targets, refuses to create parent directories, and prompts before overwriting an existing file.
- 📋 **`/copy` slash command** - copies the last assistant response to the local clipboard via a dedicated short-lived local PowerShell pipeline. Deliberately does NOT route through the active session executor, which is bound to the remote target server / JEA endpoint.
- 📊 **`/stats` slash command** - shows a session statistics table covering completed turn count, failed/cancelled turn breakdown, total token usage, p50/p95 latency, total tool-call count, and p50/p95 tool calls per turn.

### 🚀 Performance

- ⚡ **Cached `/model` discovery** - the merged GitHub-models list is now cached on `ModelDiscoveryManager` for the lifetime of the session and explicitly invalidated on `/login`, `/byok` (configure or `clear`), and `/settings` reload. Repeated `/model` invocations no longer re-issue the discovery request.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- 📐 **Narrow-terminal hardening** - the post-response status bar now uses structured fields with explicit priorities, computes width math against plain text (not Spectre markup), and progressively drops fields as the terminal narrows: `< 40 cols` suppresses entirely, `40-59 cols` keeps tokens only, and `>= 60 cols` adds session, cost, model, tools, reasoning, provider in priority order. The terminal-title OSC sequence is now gated behind the same Windows-Terminal-or-redirected check that `SetWindowsTerminalProgress` already uses.

### 🧰 Internal

- ✅ **Stats instrumentation** - `SessionUsageTracker` now records per-turn elapsed time, tool-call delta, and outcome (success / failed / cancelled) in addition to token usage, with sorted-list quantile helpers backing `/stats`. SendMessageAsync owns its own Stopwatch so tracker recording survives cancellation and exception paths via `finally`.
- 🛡️ **24 new regression tests** - covering the model-list cache, narrow-terminal status-bar fields, theme persistence and mono-mode tag stripping, save/copy helpers, and stats quantiles. Total suite now 603 tests.

## [v1.14.0] - 2026-04-30

### ✨ New Features

- 🛡️ **`SafeMarkup` helper** - new `TroubleScout.UI.SafeMarkup` provides `Escape(value)` and `Interpolate($"[red]{value}[/]")` for emitting Spectre markup that contains user- or model-controlled text. `Interpolate` auto-escapes every interpolated argument while preserving literal markup tags, eliminating the "did I forget `Markup.Escape` here?" footgun.
- 🔐 **`SecretRedactor` helper (not yet wired)** - new `TroubleScout.Services.SecretRedactor` masks secret-shaped values (GitHub PATs, AWS access keys, JWTs, Bearer tokens, URLs with userinfo, connection-string passwords, generic `api_key=` / `token=` / `secret=` pairs) with `***REDACTED***`. The helper is added in this release as a prerequisite for any expanded session persistence (opt-in transcript, `/replay`); it is not yet invoked by `/report` or conversation history. 24 tests cover each pattern category plus negative cases (`background_color=red`, `token=ok`, plain URLs without userinfo).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- 🔒 **Patch GHSA-37gx-xxp4-5rgx / GHSA-w3x6-4m5h-cxqf** - pin `System.Security.Cryptography.Xml` to `9.0.15` so `dotnet run`/`dotnet build` no longer surface `NU1903` warnings about the vulnerable `9.0.10` version that `Microsoft.PowerShell.SDK 7.5.4` pulls in transitively.
- 🧹 **Trim startup status panel** - the "MCP approved (session)" and "MCP approved (persisted)" rows no longer appear in the boot capability table; they were always empty before any approval prompt and never gained signal afterward. Both tiers are still surfaced in the HTML report.

### 🧪 Tests & Tooling

- ✅ **Pin AGENTS.md safety invariants with regression tests** - new `InvariantGuardsTests` and expanded `McpReadOnlyHeuristicTests` lock down per-server MCP approval scope, the read-only MCP heuristic, JEA `AddScript` protection, `IncludeSubAgentStreamingEvents = false`, the `PauseForApproval`/`ResumeAfterApproval` pairing for prompts shown while the spinner is live, and ESC cancellation propagation. Designed to catch regressions before larger refactors land.

### 📝 Documentation

- 📐 **`docs/architecture.md`** - promoted the AGENTS.md component diagram and key seams to a contributor-facing architecture document; linked from the README.
- 📓 **`docs/slash-commands.md`** - first manual reference of every slash command, grouped by area; linked from the README. (Will become generator-backed once the slash-command registry refactor lands.)
- ⚙️ **README "Configuration Reference" section** - one-stop reference for `settings.json` keys, BYOK environment variables, MCP role mapping, and persisted approvals.
- 🧑‍💻 **CONTRIBUTING.md human workflow** - human-only build/test/smoke instructions and version-bump rule (separate from the agent-only TDD workflow in AGENTS.md).

## [v1.13.0] - 2026-04-29

### ✨ New Features

- 🛡️ **Per-server MCP approval** - approving any tool from an MCP server now covers every tool from that server for the rest of the session, instead of re-prompting for each new tool name.
- 📌 **Persistent MCP approvals** - MCP servers mapped to a `monitoring` or `ticketing` role can now be marked as user-trusted; that approval is stored in `settings.json` and persists across sessions. Manage with the new `/mcp-approvals` slash command (`list`, `clear all`, `clear <name>`).
- 🚦 **Auto-approve clearly read-only MCP tools** - tool names starting with `get_`, `list_`, `search_`, `find_`, `describe_`, `read_`, `query_`, or `inspect_` no longer trigger approval prompts in Safe mode.
- 📝 **Markdown-rendered HTML report** - `/report` now renders assistant replies as proper Markdown (bundled `marked` + `DOMPurify`) and exposes a "Copy markdown" button next to a "Copy HTML" button. A new "Export full session as Markdown" button at the top downloads the entire transcript.
- 🧰 **Rich MCP entries in the report** - MCP actions now show the actual server, tool, full arguments, and tool output (no more `N/A`), with error styling when the call failed.
- 📊 **Status bar + session header in the report** - each prompt card now mirrors the terminal status bar (model, provider, reasoning, tokens, tools), and a session-wide summary header shows totals, models used, premium-request estimate, mapped MCP roles, and persisted approvals.
- 🎨 **Light/dark theme toggle** - the report defaults to dark and now offers a manual theme toggle that persists in `localStorage`.
- 🧭 **Floating table of contents** - the report now has a TOC sidebar on wide screens for quick navigation between prompts.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- 🔁 **Fix MCP approval re-prompt loop** - approving an MCP tool now correctly suppresses follow-up prompts for sibling tools in the same session.
- 🩹 **Stop misleading "modify system state" warning on MCP calls** - MCP approval prompts no longer reuse the shell-mutation copy and now describe the MCP invocation explicitly.

## [v1.12.0] - 2026-04-25

### ✨ New Features

- 🎛️ **Post-analysis action dialog** - after diagnosis/recommendations or after approved commands finish, TroubleScout now returns control to the user with a next-step dialog: continue investigating, apply the fix, or stop for now.
- 🎨 **Windows Terminal wait feedback** - TroubleScout now sets the running terminal title to `TroubleScout`, drives the Windows Terminal tab/taskbar progress ring with OSC `9;4`, and uses the ASCII-safe "Wheel of IT Blame" animation while the AI is busy.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- ♻️ **Stop endless post-approval recursion** - approved command follow-ups now ask the AI to summarize what changed and then yield control back to TroubleScout instead of recursively telling the model to "continue your analysis" forever.
- 💤 **Better stalled-stream visibility** - when a streamed response goes quiet mid-turn, TroubleScout now surfaces explicit wait notices while keeping the tab progress indicator active.

### 📝 Documentation & UX

- 📝 **Document the new checkpoint and waiting flow** - refreshed README and AGENTS guidance for the next-step action dialog, Windows Terminal title/progress behavior, and the new waiting animation.

## [v1.11.0] - 2026-04-25

### ✨ New Features

- 🧭 **In-app MCP role mapping** - added `/mcp-role` so monitoring and ticketing MCP roles can be assigned or cleared directly from TroubleScout without editing `settings.json` by hand.
- 🤝 **Role-aware MCP delegation** - TroubleScout now exposes focused monitoring and ticketing sub-agents that use only the mapped MCP server for that role, keeping delegated evidence collection targeted and concise.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- 🌐 **Three-way URL approval flow** - URL permission prompts now support allow-this-URL, allow-all-URLs, or deny, with per-session persistence for approved URLs.
- 🐛 **Prominent MCP role visibility** - startup hints, `/help`, and status output now make the configured monitoring/ticketing MCP roles easier to discover and confirm.

### 📝 Documentation & UX

- 📝 **Document MCP role workflows** - refreshed README and AGENTS guidance for `/mcp-role`, role-aware delegation, and session-scoped URL approval behavior.

## [v1.10.0] - 2026-04-25

### ✨ New Features

- 🚀 **Upgrade to GitHub.Copilot.SDK `0.3.0`** - TroubleScout now targets the latest Copilot SDK release, including the current MCP config types, session metrics RPC surface, and custom-agent session configuration.
- 🧭 **Focused sub-agent groundwork** - TroubleScout now provisions inferable sub-agents for server evidence collection and issue research, keeps `web_search` on the dedicated research path, and suppresses sub-agent delta streaming from the main TUI output so delegated work stays concise.
- 🏷️ **Optional monitoring/ticketing MCP roles** - `settings.json` now supports `MonitoringMcpServer` and `TicketingMcpServer` so existing MCP servers can be mapped to those org-specific roles and surfaced back to the agent and status views.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- 🐛 **Persist MCP approvals for the active session** - approving an MCP permission now returns a session-scoped SDK rule, so TroubleScout stops re-prompting for the same MCP access within the current session.
- 🐛 **Use SDK session metrics for GitHub premium request totals** - GitHub-mode session cost display now comes from `session.rpc.usage.getMetrics()` instead of TroubleScout's old local multiplier estimate.
- 🐛 **Update MCP config compatibility for SDK `0.3.0`** - MCP config parsing now maps SDK `stdio` / `http` server types while preserving compatibility with older `local` / `remote` config values.

### 📝 Documentation & UX

- 📝 **Refresh README and AGENTS guidance for SDK `0.3.0`** - updated version references, MCP-role settings, session-scoped approvals, and the new sub-agent/session-metrics behavior.

## [v1.9.2] - 2026-03-22

### 🏗️ Architecture

- **Decompose oversized classes** — extracted 14 focused service/UI classes from TroubleshootingSession.cs (6,627→4,244 lines, −36%), ConsoleUI.cs (2,300→1,319, −43%), and PowerShellExecutor.cs (990→574, −42%):
  - `Services/JsonParsingHelpers` — static JSON parsing utilities
  - `Services/PermissionEvaluator` — shell permission analysis and assessment
  - `Services/ReportHtmlBuilder` — HTML troubleshooting report generation
  - `Services/CommandValidator` — command safety validation and blocking
  - `Services/CopilotCliResolver` — CLI path resolution and prerequisite checks
  - `Services/SystemPromptBuilder` — system prompt construction
  - `Services/ModelDiscoveryManager` — model listing, pricing, and display
  - `Services/ConversationHistoryTracker` — thread-safe prompt/reply history
  - `Services/ServerConnectionManager` — multi-server session lifecycle
  - `Services/ByokProviderManager` — BYOK OpenAI configuration and auth
  - `Services/SecondOpinionService` — second-opinion prompt building
  - `UI/MarkdownStreamRenderer` — streaming markdown-to-ANSI conversion
  - `UI/ModelPickerUI` — interactive model selection UI
  - `UI/PowerShellSyntaxHighlighter` — PowerShell syntax highlighting

## [v1.9.1] - 2026-03-21

### ✨ New Features

- 🤝 **Second-opinion model switching** - after choosing a different model in `/model`, TroubleScout can now either start a new clean session or carry the recorded session transcript, assistant replies, and tool actions into the new model for a second opinion.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- 🐛 **Keep clean model switches truly clean** - choosing the clean-session path during `/model` now clears the recorded conversation history instead of only recreating the SDK session.
- 🐛 **Restore ESC cancellation for second opinions** - second-opinion handoff requests now use the same interactive ESC cancellation flow as normal prompts, so long-running follow-up analysis can still be cancelled cleanly.

### 📝 Documentation & UX

- 📝 **Update `/model` help and README** - documented the new session handoff choice in the interactive command reference and model-selection section.

## [v1.9.0] - 2026-03-21

### ✨ New Features

- 🚀 **Upgrade to GitHub.Copilot.SDK `0.2.0`** - TroubleScout now uses the latest Copilot SDK release, including earlier session lifecycle hooks and the newer system-prompt customization model.
- 🧠 **First-class reasoning control** - compatible models now support a persisted `/reasoning` command so users can choose an explicit reasoning effort (or return to automatic behavior) and see the active setting in model details, `/status`, and the post-response status bar.
- ✏️ **Pre-populated editable prompt defaults** - `settings.json` is now seeded with the built-in prompt sections (`investigation_approach`, `response_format`, `troubleshooting_approach`, `safety`) so users can edit the current prompt guidance directly instead of starting from empty keys.
- ⚡ **Faster read-only diagnostic flow** - the built-in `get_*` diagnostic helpers now opt into SDK `skip_permission`, so routine data collection no longer incurs extra Copilot permission prompts.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- 🐛 **Fix SDK `0.2.0` permission compatibility** - TroubleScout now handles the SDK's typed `PermissionRequest` hierarchy instead of relying on the removed extension-data payload.
- 🐛 **Fix multiline shell previews** - permission previews now collapse embedded newlines into a single readable command preview instead of truncating after the first line.
- 🐛 **Fix doubled usage totals** - session token and cost totals are no longer double-counted after the new early-event wiring.

### 📝 Documentation & UX

- 📝 **Refresh README for reasoning and prompt editing** - documented the new `/reasoning` control, clarified that `/settings` writes seeded prompt defaults, and refreshed the interactive command reference.
- 📝 **Update release-process examples** - versioned WinGet validation and release-tag examples now reference the `v1.9.0` release line.

## [v1.8.3] - 2026-03-18

### ✨ New Features

- 💰 **LiteLLM pricing fallback for BYOK models** — when the BYOK provider's `/models` endpoint doesn't include pricing metadata, TroubleScout now falls back to a curated LiteLLM-based pricing database covering ~80 popular chat models (GPT, Claude, Gemini, Llama, Mistral, etc.). Estimated prices are shown with a `~` prefix (e.g., `~$2.50/M in`) to clearly indicate they are estimates.
- 📊 **Session cost & token tracking** — the status bar after each AI response now shows cumulative session totals: total input/output tokens, estimated cost for BYOK models (`~$0.04 est.`), or estimated premium requests for GitHub models (`~2.5 premium reqs`).
- 🔍 **Autonomous investigation prompt** — system prompts now instruct the AI to exhaust all available diagnostic tools before asking the user, reducing unnecessary back-and-forth during troubleshooting.
- ✏️ **User-editable system prompts** — system prompt sections are now customizable via `settings.json`. Use `SystemPromptOverrides` (keyed by section name) to replace default sections, or `SystemPromptAppend` to add custom instructions.
- 🧹 **BYOK chat-only model filter** — the model picker now hides non-chat models (image generators, embedding models, audio models, etc.) when using BYOK providers, keeping the list focused on relevant models.
- 📐 **Fixed-width model selection table** — the `/model` picker table and panels now always expand to full terminal width, eliminating jarring resizes when model names or metadata vary in length.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- 🐛 **Auto-approve read-only PowerShell shell commands** — Safe mode now reuses TroubleScout's PowerShell safety validator for PowerShell-shaped `shell` permission requests, so read-only pipelines like `Get-ChildItem | Select-Object | Sort-Object` no longer trigger a misleading approval prompt.

### 📝 Documentation & UX

- 📝 **Clarify shell approval messaging** — when a PowerShell shell command still needs approval, the prompt now explains whether it is blocked, ambiguous, or simply not classified as read-only instead of always implying that every shell command is mutating.
- 📝 **AGENTS.md TDD workflow** — added a Development Workflow (TDD) section documenting the required test-driven development process for coding agents.

## [v1.8.2] - 2026-03-16

### ✨ Features

- 🔐 **Add startup `--jea` support** — TroubleScout can now preconnect a single JEA endpoint at launch with `--jea <server> <configurationName>`, making headless validation and smoke testing possible without going through the interactive TUI first.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- 🐛 **Fix JEA no-language runspaces** — JEA command execution now avoids the script-wrapper path that failed on no-language endpoints, so command discovery and constrained command execution can succeed.
- 🐛 **Remove redundant `/jea` approval prompt** — explicitly choosing `/jea` no longer triggers an extra Safe-mode confirmation before the session is established.
- 🐛 **Guide `/jea` input interactively** — entering `/jea` without parameters now prompts for the server name and configuration name instead of failing with usage-only output.

### 📝 Documentation & UX

- 📝 **Use generic JEA examples** — help text and docs now use placeholders like `server1` and `JEA-Admins` instead of real-looking infrastructure names.
- 📝 **Document JEA CLI parity** — README, release guidance, and AGENTS guidance now reflect the `--jea` startup flag and the updated `/jea` UX.

## [v1.8.1] - 2026-03-14

### ✨ Features

- 🚀 **Automated WinGet PR workflow** — published GitHub Releases can now trigger a dedicated `.github/workflows/winget.yml` job that uses `winget-releaser` to open or update the `microsoft/winget-pkgs` manifest PR for `sasler.TroubleScout`.

### 📝 Documentation & UX

- 📝 **Document WinGet automation setup** — release docs now cover the required `winget-pkgs` fork, `WINGET_TOKEN` secret, manual retry flow, and why WinGet submission runs separately from the main release workflow.
- 🧪 **Add local WinGet validation helper** — new `Tools/Validate-WinGetRelease.ps1` can download release zips, generate the TroubleScout manifest, run `winget validate`, and optionally invoke the official `winget-pkgs` Sandbox test before or after release publication.
- 📝 **Refresh versioned examples** — README, workflow examples, and release-process command samples now reference the `v1.8.1` release line.

## [v1.8.0] - 2026-03-13

### ✨ Features

- 🔐 **JEA (Just Enough Administration) support** — new `/jea <server> <configurationName>` slash command and `connect_jea_server` AI tool for constrained PowerShell endpoints. Automatically discovers available commands via `Get-Command` and strictly enforces the allowed command list — all other commands are blocked. System message is updated to inform the AI agent of available JEA commands.
- 🔧 **Configurable safe commands** — `SafeCommands` list in `settings.json` with wildcard support (e.g., `"Get-*"`). Pre-populated with defaults on first load. Dangerous verb wildcards (`Remove-*`, `Set-*`, etc.) are rejected as a safety guardrail. Changes are applied immediately when settings are reloaded.
- ⚙️ **`/settings` slash command** — opens `settings.json` in the configured editor (`EDITOR`/`VISUAL` env vars, fallback to `notepad`). Reloads and applies settings changes live after editor closes.
- ⚡ **Immediate startup feedback** — shows target server info before the initialization spinner for faster perceived startup.
- 🎨 **Redesigned HTML report** — modern dark-mode design with hero header, summary statistics cards, timeline-style prompt cards, color-coded approval states, copy-to-clipboard buttons, line-numbered code blocks, AI chat bubble for agent replies, print-friendly and responsive layout.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- 🐛 **Fix report opening as wrong user** — replaced `UseShellExecute` with `cmd.exe /c start` to respect the current process user context when running via RunAs.

### 🛡️ Security

- 🛡️ **JEA fail-closed validation** — JEA sessions block all commands until command discovery completes. Localhost JEA connections are rejected (requires remote target). Command-position-only extraction prevents false matches on hyphenated parameter values.
- 🛡️ **Safe command wildcard guardrails** — bare `"*"` and dangerous verb wildcards (e.g., `"Remove-*"`, `"Stop-*"`) are silently rejected to prevent accidental auto-approval of destructive commands.

## [v1.7.0] - 2026-03-12

### ✨ Features

- ✨ **Enhanced permission prompts** — approval dialogs now use a three-option `SelectionPrompt` (Yes / No / Explain). Choosing "Explain" shows a detailed command breakdown before re-prompting for approval.
- 📊 **Always-visible status bar** — a compact info line showing model, provider, token usage, and tool invocation count is displayed after every AI response.
- ⏱️ **Elapsed timer in thinking indicator** — the spinner now shows total elapsed time (e.g., `Thinking... (12s) — ESC to cancel`). Per-phase timers reset on each status change. Long-running phases trigger yellow warnings at 30s and 60s.
- 🛡️ **Activity watchdog** — a background watchdog during `SendMessageAsync` detects inactivity: 15s idle shows "Waiting for response", 30s shows "Connection seems slow" in the thinking indicator.
- 🔄 **Retry prompt** — new `ShowRetryPrompt` provides a Retry/Skip selection after errors or timeouts instead of silently failing.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- 🐛 **Cleaner ESC cancellation** — improved interaction between ESC polling and error states to reduce spurious "Communication error" messages.
- 🐛 **Thinking indicator clarity** — spinner now consistently shows "ESC to cancel" (was "ESC to stop") and includes elapsed time for better user orientation.

### 📝 Documentation & UX

- 📝 Update README with new approval flow, status bar, timer, and watchdog features.
- 📝 Update AGENTS.md Notable UX Behaviors with approval prompt, status bar, and watchdog details.

## [v1.6.0] - 2026-03-11

### ✨ Features

- ✨ **GitHub.Copilot.SDK upgraded to v0.1.32** — picks up the newer typed permission-result API and CLI compatibility improvements while keeping the existing event-streaming architecture.
- 🤖 **Richer model metadata and picker UX** — `/model` now shows provider-specific entries only for connected providers, restores GitHub premium multipliers, shows BYOK pricing when provider metadata includes it, supports ESC to keep the current model, and shows a clearer post-selection model summary.
- 📊 **More informative status view** — `/status` now groups provider, usage, and capability details more clearly and keeps the combined context-used/max view prominent.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- 🐛 **Fix Safe-mode approval dialog details** — permission prompts once again show the actual requested shell command or MCP tool details instead of a generic placeholder.
- 🐛 **Fix reasoning/output ordering** — reasoning is now kept strictly ahead of the assistant response, with a visible blank line separator and no late reasoning tokens after the response starts.
- 🐛 **Fix startup model fallback after SDK upgrade** — TroubleScout now resolves a verified available model at startup instead of depending on an invalid default model selection.
- 🐛 **Fix test settings leakage** — model-switch tests now use isolated settings storage so they cannot overwrite the real user profile state while validating provider switching.

### 📝 Documentation & UX

- 📝 Update README and agent guidance for SDK `0.1.32`, richer `/model` metadata, BYOK model metadata handling, and the refreshed status display.

## [v1.5.0] - 2026-03-03

### ✨ Features

- 🔌 **Multi-server `--server` flag** — Pass `--server` multiple times or use comma-separated values to connect to several servers at startup (e.g., `--server srv1 --server srv2` or `--server srv1,srv2`). CLI help updated to reflect multi-server syntax.
- 🖥️ **`/server` slash command** (replaces `/connect`) — Consistent with the CLI flag. Accepts multiple servers in a single call: `/server srv1 srv2` or `/server srv1,srv2`. Both space- and comma-separated syntax work.
- ⏹️ **ESC cancels the in-progress agent turn** — Press ESC while the AI is thinking to cancel the current turn at the SDK level. The spinner now shows `(ESC to stop)` at all times as a visible hint. On cancellation a clear `[Cancelled]` indicator is shown.
- ⌨️ **Prompt history** — Up/Down arrow keys recall previous inputs during the interactive prompt. ESC clears the current input buffer.
- 💭 **Reasoning display** — When a model emits reasoning/thinking tokens (`AssistantReasoningEvent`), they are streamed in dark grey with a 💭 prefix before the main response, giving visibility into the model's thought process.

### ⬆️ Dependencies

- ⬆️ **GitHub.Copilot.SDK upgraded to v0.1.29** — Removes the `--headless` flag that caused startup crashes with Copilot CLI v0.0.420. Adds defensive error handling around SDK startup to surface clean diagnostics on failure.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- 🐛 **Fix PSSession approval dialog** — The `LiveThinkingIndicator` background spinner was overwriting `AnsiConsole.Confirm` prompts for `connect_server` approval. The indicator now pauses during approval dialogs and resumes after.
- 🐛 **Fix `/byok clear` memory state** — `/byok clear` now resets in-memory BYOK state so a subsequent `/model` switch does not re-save `UseByokOpenAi=true` to disk.
- 🐛 **Fix multi-server agent awareness** — Agent system message now lists all active PSSessions so the AI knows which servers are connected without needing to ask the user.
- 🐛 **Fix reasoning display** — Reasoning tokens now stream incrementally via `AssistantReasoningDeltaEvent` instead of appearing all at once.

### ✨ Additions

- ✨ **`--no-byok` CLI flag** — Forces the GitHub Copilot provider at startup, ignoring any saved BYOK provider selection.

## [v1.4.0] - 2026-02-27

✨ **Features**

- 🖧 **Multi-server PSSession support** — Use `connect_server` and `close_server_session` tools to establish direct connections to multiple servers, avoiding PowerShell Remoting double-hop authentication issues. Run commands on any connected server via `run_powershell` with an optional `sessionName` parameter.
- 🔀 **Accurate provider/model switching** — Dual-source models (available via both GitHub Copilot and BYOK) now appear as separate entries in `/model`, making it explicit which provider will be used. Post-switch confirmation shows both model and provider.
- 🔧 **Richer tool/MCP usage display** — Tool invocations show human-readable descriptions (e.g., "Scanning Event Logs" instead of "get_event_logs"). MCP tool calls show the server name. Tool invocation count tracked in `/status`.

🛡️ **Reliability & Safety Improvements**

- ⬆️ **GitHub.Copilot.SDK updated to v0.1.28** — addresses breaking change requiring permission handler; read-only tool operations auto-approved in all modes; mutating MCP/shell operations prompt for approval in Safe mode.
- 🔒 **Execution mode changes apply live** — switching `/mode safe` or `/mode yolo` now immediately affects permission decisions, including for active multi-server sessions.
- 🛡️ **Multi-session command routing** — Approved commands for alternate server sessions now execute on the correct server, with proper target verification.
- 🔁 **Session executor robustness** — Additional PSSession executors are safely disposed even if one fails; execution mode propagates to all active sessions.

📝 **Documentation & UX**

- 💬 **Clearer AI guidance** — System message now explicitly encourages tool use, explains read-only tools auto-execute in all modes, and includes double-hop avoidance instructions.
- 📊 **Provider row in status** — `/status` and `/capabilities` now show the active provider (GitHub Copilot or BYOK) as a dedicated row alongside the AI model.

## [v1.3.4] - 2026-02-27

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- 🐛 Fix `--help` / `-h` to display proper CLI usage (flags, options, examples) instead of the TUI slash-command reference
